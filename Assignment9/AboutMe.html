			<p class="about"> I, am a very precise, rational, and linear thinker. I strive to meet a standard of perfection in my work. I enjoy symmetry, balance, and rhythmic forms of art. Having everything able to fall into place so perfectly and evenly is euphoria to me. Systems like this create some of the most structurally sound designs and yet it can all fall apart with even the smallest of imperfections. Finding the balance between these points is what I strive to achieve in my work.
										<br> <br>		That doesn’t mean, however, that I won’t have a more ambiguous idea every once in a while. One of the most enjoyable things to do in life is to make something that makes people smile. To give a sense of wonder and stun them with amazement is what ultimately makes me happy regardless of what it is.</p>
